Once clicked, it shows a Feedback form:

The user can select what type of feedback to send and fill in a text box. Once the user clicks <em>Send</em> a Thank you message shows up and the dialog disappears.

All messages are saved as "Feedback" Events in Google Analytics.

## Feedback Dashboard

The Feedback widget dashboard is a readymade dashboard that displays user's feedback in tables (these are sorted by Number of Sessions per User so more active users show up first). The right column has a few other things like a pie chart and a timeline of all feedback received.

Feedback submissions are saved as Events in Google Analytics (<em>Reporting</em> > <em>Behaviour</em> > <em>Events</em>).

- **Events Category**: <code>Feedback</code>
- **Events Action**: <code>Angry</code>, <code>Sad</code>, <code>Meh</code>, <code>Happy</code> or <code>Excited</code>
- **Events Label**: User's feedback
- **Events Value**: <code>1</code>
